The data originates from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) and is submitted by authorized technology providers under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP). While the TLC does not create or guarantee the accuracy of this data, it regularly reviews the records and enforces measures to maintain, as much as possible, the data's completeness and reliability.

This project focuses on analyzing Yellow Taxi trip data from January to June 2024. The dataset provides comprehensive records including pick-up and drop-off dates and times, locations, trip distances, itemized fare components, rate types, payment methods, and passenger counts as reported by drivers.
